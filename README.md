A problem from, Kocha, Stephen, "Programming in C 4th ed"

Develop insertEntry() and deleteEntry() for a doubly linked list. insertEntry()
has the same quirks as before, but deleteEntry() now takes a direct pointer to 
the entry to be deleted.
## Things to do
Get the, "mule", created. The basic form and a printList() function.
Work on insertEntry().
Work on deleteEntry().
## Things done
Mule created. List and printList() done.
